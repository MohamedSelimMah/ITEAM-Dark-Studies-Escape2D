This project was jointly developed between Mohamed Selim Mahjoub and Mohamed Amin Helaoui. The players are thrown into the middle of a suspense story. In this story, a student who comes at night to study at ITEAM University has to be in terrible night visions. Escaping requires finding a hidden key while avoiding the mysterious events happening in the shadows.
