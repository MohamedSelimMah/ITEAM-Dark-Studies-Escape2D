#ITEAM: Dark Studies Escape #
ITEAM: Dark Studies is a Java-developed 2D horror adventure game that was undertaken during the first semester of the second year in Software Engineering.
This project was jointly developed between Mohamed Selim Mahjoub and Mohamed Amin Helaoui. The players are thrown into the middle of a suspense story. In this story,
a student who comes at night to study at ITEAM University has to be in terrible night visions. Escaping requires finding a hidden key while avoiding the mysterious events happening in the shadows.
